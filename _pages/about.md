I am currently a PhD student working under the supervision of Prof. [Lucile Sassatelli](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/~sassatelli/) at the I3S lab, part of Université Côte d'Azur and CNRS, in Sophia Antipolis, France. 

My ongoing research work focuses on using deep learning approaches to improve virtual reality (VR) streaming. Over the course of my PhD, I have been working on predicting the head movements of people watching 360° videos, studying the uncertainty of such predictions, as well as trying to understand the link between video content, emotions and head motion.

I am expected to graduate by the end of 2023, and I am now looking for an academic (postdoc) or industrial research position in the field of deep learning. You can reach me by writing to `quentin.guimard[at]univ-cotedazur[dot]fr`.
