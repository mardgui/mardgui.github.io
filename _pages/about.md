I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow working in the [Multimedia and Human Understanding Group (MHUG)](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it), part of the [Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science (DISI)](https://www.disi.unitn.it/) of the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/).

My ongoing research work focuses on bias detection and mitigation in deep visual recognition models (primarily image classifiers).
